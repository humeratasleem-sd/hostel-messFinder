HOW TO ADD BACKGROUND IMAGE:

1. Save the South Indian food image (dosa/idli platter) you want to use
2. Rename it to: food-bg.jpg
3. Copy it to this folder: c:\Users\konda\Downloads\hostel-mess-finder\frontend\images\
4. The image will automatically appear as the background on the landing page

Current path expected: c:\Users\konda\Downloads\hostel-mess-finder\frontend\images\food-bg.jpg

The code is already configured to use this image with:
- 60% dark overlay for readability
- Fixed background (parallax effect)
- Applied to hero, features, how-it-works, and stats sections
